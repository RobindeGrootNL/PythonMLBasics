# PythonMLBasics
The first four programming assignments of the Machine Learning Coursera course by Stanford (Andrew Ng) translated from Matlab to Python.

The code from the Coursera assignments was 'translated' quite literally from Matlab to Python. Therefore, there are probably more efficient ways to program the same functions in Python. The aim of this project was to make sure that the assignment descriptions from the Coursera course still fit the actual coding as closely as possible, which was a demand of the teacher who gave this assignment. This assignment was completed in 2018.
